Recently, the annual number of driver deaths per 100,000 for the selected age groups was as follows:

| Age |	Number of Driver Deaths per 100,000 
|-----|-----
| 17.5 |	38 
|22|	36 
|29.5|	24
|44.5|	20
|64.5|	18

# Questions

- For each age group, pick the midpoint of the interval for the x value. (For the 75+ group, use 80.)
- Using “ages” as the independent variable and “Number of driver deaths per 100,000” as the dependent variable, make a scatter plot of the data.
- Calculate the least squares (best–fit) line. Put the equation in the form of: ŷ = a + bx
- Predict the number of deaths for ages 40 and 60.
- Based on the given data, is there a linear relationship between age of a driver and driver fatality rate?
- Find the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r). Is it significant?
